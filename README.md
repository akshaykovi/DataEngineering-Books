# 📌 Recommended Learning Path for Mastering Data Engineering in 2025
# 
# Phase 1: Fundamentals of Data Engineering
# 
# Fundamentals of Data Engineering - Joe Reis & Matt Housley
# 🚀 A must-read! Covers modern data engineering practices, concepts, and real-world examples.
# Designing Data-Intensive Applications - Martin Kleppmann
# 🔍 The bible for understanding distributed systems, databases, and scalability.
# The Data Warehouse Toolkit (3rd Edition) - Ralph Kimball & Margy Ross
# 🏛️ Best for mastering dimensional modeling, crucial for warehouse design.
# Python for Data Analysis - Wes McKinney
# 🐍 Essential for learning Pandas, data manipulation, and EDA.
# 
# Phase 2: Big Data & Processing Frameworks
# 
# Spark: The Definitive Guide - Big Data Processing Made Simple - Bill Chambers & Matei Zaharia
# 🔥 Learn Apache Spark in-depth (batch & streaming).
# Hadoop: The Definitive Guide - Tom White (Replace with a more concise resource if needed)
# 📀 Covers Hadoop ecosystem (HDFS, MapReduce, Hive, Sqoop).
# Big Data: Principles and Best Practices of Scalable Real-Time Data Systems - Nathan Marz
# 🌍 Covers Lambda & Kappa architectures, real-time data processing.
# 
# Phase 3: Data Pipelines & Cloud Engineering
# 
# Building Reliable Data Pipelines with Modern Tools (Rebuilding Reliable Data Pipelines) - Andreas Kretz (or Data Pipelines Pocket Reference by James Densmore)
# 🏗️ Learn Airflow, Kafka, orchestration, and modern pipeline strategies.
# Data Science on AWS - Chris Fregly & Antje Barth
# ☁️ Great for understanding cloud-native data engineering solutions (S3, Glue, Redshift, etc.).
# The Data Engineering Cookbook - Andreas Kretz
# 📘 Covers practical data engineering skills, tools, and case studies.
# 
# Phase 4: Advanced Topics & Specializations
# 
# Streaming Systems - Tyler Akidau (Better for real-time data streaming than Flink-specific books)
# ⏳ Covers event-driven architectures, Flink, Kafka Streams.
# The Missing Data Warehouse Book - Daniel Ziegler (Better alternative to SQL Server-specific book)
# 🏭 Covers modern data warehousing concepts and cloud solutions.
# Practical DataOps - Harvinder Atwal (To learn about DataOps best practices)
# ⚙️ Covers CI/CD, observability, and automation in data engineering.
# 
# 📌 Books Removed & Why:
# 
# Data Engineering with Python - (Too basic; replace with The Data Engineering Cookbook + Fundamentals of Data Engineering)
# Data Science for Dummies - (Not relevant to data engineering; Python for Data Analysis is a better alternative)
# Building a Data Warehouse with SQL Server - (Too platform-specific; replaced with The Missing Data Warehouse Book)
# Scientific Python Lectures - (More suited for ML/DS, not data engineering)
# Python Data Science Handbook - (More for ML/DS than data engineering; Python for Data Analysis is sufficient)
